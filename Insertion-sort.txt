INSERTION SORT
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. 
It is like sorting playing cards in your hands. You split the cards into two groups: the sorted cards and the unsorted cards. 
Then, you pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the sorted group.

It's like....
You will sort arr[:1]
then arr[:2]
then arr[:3]
then arr[:4}
.
.
.
.
then arr[:n]

def insertion_sort(arr, n):
  for i in range(1, n):
    j = i - 1
    k = arr[i]
    while j >= 0 and k < arr[j]:
      arr[j+1] = arr[j]
      j -= 1
    arr[j+1] = k
