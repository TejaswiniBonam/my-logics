❤️ 1. count set bits:
		while n > 0:
			ct += 1
			n = n&(n-1) //reduces one left most 1 in binary
❤️ 2. There are X teams... In first round X/2 matches.. The lost X/2 teams will eliminated... next round x/4 matches held from x/2 teams.. x/4 eliminates.. etc etc
	No o f rounds held = Log(X)
❤️ 3. PRIME NUMBER
	sqrt(n) cuz... 100 1x100, 2x50, 4x25, 5x20, 10x10 now everything repeates 20x5, 25x4,50x2,100x1... so we just need to check until sqrt(n)	

		
	public boolean f(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return false; // 1 is not prime
    if (n <= 3) return true; // 2 and 3 are prime
    if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) return false; // multiples of 2 and 3 are not prime
    for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6) {
        if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
	}
❤️ 4. SUM OF DIGITS of number until get single digit
	if n==0 : return 0
	elif n%9==0: return 9
	else: return n%9
❤️ 5. NO OF TRAILING ZEROES IN A FACTORIAL OF N
	first check how many 5's are there from 1 to n
	check how many 2nd 5's and 3rd 5's etc etc etc
	res = 0
	while n>=5:
		n//=5
		res += n
	print(res)
❤️ 6. u have 1 to n numbers and u can take any two numbers so that the gcd is max
	ans = n//2 (floor values)

❤️ 7.  while True:
    		try:
        		x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
   		 except:
       			 break
    		finally:
        		print(max(x*y-z, 0))
	from this i gotto know that even i write break in except block, the finally block still executes which results the value error saying x not defined
